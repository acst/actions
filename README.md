# Actions

This repository is used for creating GitHub Actions. These Actions were developed with the intent of internal use to ACST. Outside collaborators are welcome to contribute.

## Testing

There is a GitHub workflow called `Testing` that is used to test the Actions out. I have yet to find a way to test these on local machines so it is easiest to create a workflow and push up changes. The workflow does require the repository be checked out so that it can use a local reference to the action rather than a git reference.
